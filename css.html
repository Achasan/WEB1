    <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
        [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        canvasSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
        and fonts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
        in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
        content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.
